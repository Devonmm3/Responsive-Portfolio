                style="width:200px; height:250px">I grew up in Connecticut and studied literature and education at
            the University of CT, where I
            graduated
            with my bacholers in 2010. After college I moved to California, where I taught third grade at a
            Charter
            school and decided that teaching wasn't for me. I worked in hospitality, insurance and became a
            certified
            yoga teacher before moving back to the East Coast in 2016.</p>
        <p>After moving to Northern Virginia, I decided that I wanted to be a part of the tech world. I love
            the
            fast
            pace of the industry and that there are always more things to learn and discover. I also feel very
            strongly
            that Tech needs more women in the industry, and I want to be a part of it. I am so happy to be a
            part
            of
            the George Washington Bootcamp and I can't wait to see what the future holds for me.</p>
        <p>Some of my favorite things to do are yoga, cooking (specifically vegan food), work out at the gym,
            read,
            spend time with my dog and be outside.</p>
